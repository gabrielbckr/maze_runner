# Maze Runner
This is a multithread maze explorer written in c# to find the scape of the maze faster than an single explroation.

This is similar to the repo TP-ATR in my account wich inplements it in C++.

The task doesn't offer any threading issue like race condition, so it's easy to learn basic concepts and syntax.
